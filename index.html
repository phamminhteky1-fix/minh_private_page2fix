   <p>I was born on 12th of June, 2013. Since I was 4, I knew how to power My dad's computer on or off. At the summer of 2021, because I love to play with LEGOs very much, my mom sent me to a robotic class, without knowing this is going to be an turning point of her son's life. At there, I get familar with progamming and engeneering. At level 4, I learns to progam the robots using Scratch. This intrests me and when I switched to learn Scratch, my teacher named my first account and now one of the 2 alts: phamminhteky1. Afterwards, I created 1 more account and now it's the main Scratch: phamminhteky1new.</p></body></div><br>

    <summary>The answer of 1+1</summary>
    <h2>We have a total of 6 ways to express 1+1</h2>
<ol>
    <li>3. A hilarious way to say the answer and, I just found on Scratch a project which shows the proof to 1+1=3. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1012816216/">Click here</a> to see... </li>
    <li>11. Add the 1 to the 1.</li>
    <li>6. Show your hands up and calculate. Renember add the + and = and the 2</li>
    <li>1. Just the same thing, right?</li>
    <li>Window. Look at this image below: <br>
